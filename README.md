# Circle-Finder
Ap Computer science project now available to public.


Per the create task guidelines, releasing to public is now allowed since AP testing results were released over 1 year ago.


To navigate to the form view controller that contains much of my personal code, direct yourself to the "controllers" folder and open the "CalculationViewController.swift".
To navigate to the file containing the calculations please go to the "controllers" folder and open the file named "CalculationLogistics.swift".

If you have any questions, please email me directly.
